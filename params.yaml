AUGMENTATION: True                 # âœ… Keep this True to improve generalization
IMAGE_SIZE: [224, 224, 3]          # âœ… Reasonable size for pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet
BATCH_SIZE: 16                    # ðŸ”¼ Increase batch size for more stable gradients (if memory allows)
INCLUDE_TOP: False                 # âœ… Keep this False to add your custom classifier
EPOCHS: 20                         # ðŸ”¼ Increase to 20â€“30 for better learning on medical datasets
CLASSES: 2                         # âœ… Binary classification: cancer / no cancer
WEIGHTS: imagenet                  # âœ… Use transfer learning as medical datasets are often small
LEARNING_RATE: 0.0001              # ðŸ”½ Lower the LR for fine-tuning pre-trained weights
